My name is Raphael, I'm a FullStack Developer from Brazil! :computer:

ðŸ’¬ My name is Raphael Augusto, I'm from Brazil, I'm an Full-Stack developer and by now my focus is mobile development.

ðŸ“š I'm currently doing Software Engineering. But I had most of my time doing freelances jobs, getting experience and learning coding from courses and for my own.

ðŸ’» I have experience using Typescript, Java, Javascript and his frameworks, I also have experience with 
relational and non-relational databases. I had to learn C, which I used for my college, some freelances jobs and my own projects. But now I'm focused on Javascript, and I'm also learning Python in my free time.
